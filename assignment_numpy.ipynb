    "#Key Features of ndarrays:\n",
    "#1.Multi-dimensional: Unlike Python lists, which are inherently 1D, ndarrays can be multi-dimensional (1D, 2D, 3D, or more). This makes them ideal for representing matrices, tensors, and other higher-dimensional data.\n",
    "#2.Homogeneous Data: All elements in an ndarray are of the same data type (e.g., int32, float64), which optimizes memory usage and computational speed.\n",
    "#3.Efficient Memory Layout: Ndarrays store elements in contiguous blocks of memory, allowing for efficient access and operations, unlike Python lists, which are arrays of pointers to objects.\n",
    "#4.Broadcasting: Ndarrays support broadcasting, allowing operations on arrays of different shapes without needing to manually reshape them.\n",
    "#5.Vectorized Operations: Arithmetic and mathematical operations can be performed element-wise on entire arrays without using loops, leading to faster execution.\n",
    "#6.Shape and Size: Ndarrays have built-in attributes like .shape (the dimensions of the array) and .size (total number of elements), making it easy to manage and manipulate data.\n",
    "#7.Slicing and Indexing: You can access and modify specific elements, rows, columns, or sub-arrays using slicing and advanced indexing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#NumPy arrays (ndarrays) and Python lists have several key differences:\n",
    "#1.Data Type: NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers or floats). In contrast, Python lists can hold elements of different types (e.g., a mix of integers, strings, and floats).\n",
    "#2.Memory Usage: NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient because they store data in contiguous blocks of memory. Python lists are less efficient because they store pointers to objects, which adds overhead.\n",
    "#3.Speed: NumPy arrays are faster for numerical operations due to their efficient memory usage and support for vectorized operations. Python lists are slower, especially for large datasets, since numerical tasks require looping through elements manually.\n",
    "#4.Dimensionality: NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.), making them ideal for working with matrices and higher-dimensional data. Python lists are typically 1D, and multi-dimensional lists require nesting, which is less efficient.\n",
    "#5.Mathematical Operations: With NumPy arrays, you can perform element-wise mathematical operations directly (e.g., adding arrays). With Python lists, you need to use loops or list comprehensions to perform similar operations.\n",
    "#6.Flexibility: Python lists are more flexible as they can store mixed data types and easily change size. NumPy arrays, on the other hand, are less flexible because they are fixed in size and require all elements to be of the same type.\n",

Python lists require manual looping or external libraries to perform similar tasks, which are generally slower.\n",
    "#4.Broadcasting: NumPy supports broadcasting, allowing operations on arrays of different shapes without the need for manual reshaping. This feature optimizes performance by minimizing the creation of temporary arrays.\n",

    "#Functionality of array_split()\n",
    "#Basic Usage:\n",
    "#The primary function of array_split() is to divide an input array into a specified number of equal (or nearly equal) sub-arrays.\n",
    "#If the array cannot be divided evenly, it distributes the elements as evenly as possible across the sub-arrays. \n",
    "#Parameters:\n",
    "#ary: The input array you want to split.\n",
    "#indices_or_sections: This can be an integer (the number of sub-arrays) or a 1D array of indices at which to split the array.\n",
    "#axis: The axis along which to split the array. The default is 0 (along the first axis).\n",
    "#Return Value:\n",
    "#It returns a list of sub-arrays.\n",
    "#Handling Uneven Splits\n",
    "#When you specify an integer for indices_or_sections and the array cannot be evenly divided, array_split() will create sub-arrays with sizes that differ by at most one element. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#If you have an array of size n and want to split it into 𝑘 sub-arrays, the sizes of the resulting sub-arrays will be distributed as evenly as possible.\n",
    "#For example, if 𝑛 =10 and 𝑘=3, the resulting sub-arrays might have sizes 4, 3, and 3.\n",
    "array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n",
    "result_uneven = np.array_split(array, 4)\n",
    "print(\"Uneven Split Result:\")\n",
    "print(result_uneven)\n"

    "#1. Vectorization\n",
    "#Definition: Vectorization refers to the process of replacing explicit loops in numerical computations with array operations. Instead of iterating over each element in an array and performing calculations using Python loops, vectorized operations enable you to apply functions to entire arrays at once.\n",
    "#Benefits:\n",
    "#Performance: Vectorized operations are implemented in low-level languages (like C) and are optimized for performance. They execute much faster than Python loops due to reduced overhead.\n",
    "#Readability: Code using vectorized operations is often more concise and easier to read, as it eliminates the need for explicit iteration.\n",

    "#NumPy compares the shapes of the two arrays involved in the operation from the trailing dimensions (rightmost).\n",
